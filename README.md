The project is a music visualizer Android (15+) application, that should be used
along with a simple Do-It-Yourself acetate pyramid. The program analyzes
the phoneâ€™s current audio output and provided enjoying displays based on its waveform.
The user should put the pyramid on the center of these displays, in order to get a
hologram simulation.

The app is still under development. Currently the app is capable of providing music visualization effects, but they are still not properly displayed for being used along with the pyramid.

# Building the Pyramid
The user needs to print the pyramid model (which is provided in the app) on an A4
acetate sheet, cut it, fold it and it is done. The whole process should cost no more than 1
euro in a printer store and less than thirty minutes to build it.
The complete step-by-step (along with the pyramid template) can be found in the app or in this [tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/No-CD-case-no-tape-3D-hologram-pyramid-the-quickes/).
